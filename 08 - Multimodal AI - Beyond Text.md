# Multimodal AI: Beyond Text

**Learning goal:** Understand AI that works across images, audio, video, and combinations - expanding beyond text-only applications.

---

# What is Multimodal AI?

## Definition
**Multimodal AI** refers to systems that can understand and/or generate multiple types of content: text, images, audio, video, and combinations thereof.

## The Evolution

**Early AI (pre-2020):**
- Separate models for each modality
- Text model, image model, audio model - no connection

**Modern Multimodal AI (2020+):**
- Single model understands multiple types
- Can combine modalities (describe images, generate images from text)
- Unified understanding across formats

> 🌐 **Why this matters:** Humans naturally work across modalities - we read text, look at images, listen to audio, watch videos. Multimodal AI brings AI closer to how humans actually process information.

- Natural conversations mixing modalities
- Context persists across different content

**Richer understanding:**
- Combine text with visual content
- Explain images with words
- Analyze relationships between modalities

**New applications:**
- Accessibility (describe images for blind users)
- Education (explain diagrams, charts)
- Healthcare (analyze medical images + records)
- Customer service (understand product photos + questions)

> 🤝 **The future is multimodal:** Just as humans combine sight, sound, and text, AI is moving toward models that naturally handle all modalities. Single-modality models will become specialized tools, while multimodal models become the default.
