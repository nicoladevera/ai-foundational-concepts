# 🧭 Your Learning Journey

These pages are designed to build on each other, taking you from foundational concepts to practical implementation. Here's the recommended reading order and how each topic connects:

## 🏛️ Foundation Layer: Understanding AI

### 1. Machine Learning 101

**Start here if:** You're brand new to AI or want to understand the fundamentals

**What you'll learn:** How machines learn from data, types of machine learning, and where different technologies fit in the AI landscape

**Sets up:** Everything else - ML is the foundation that powers all modern AI

---

### 2. LLMs 101

**Read after:** Machine Learning 101

**What you'll learn:** How Large Language Models work, their capabilities and limitations, and why they're transformative

**Sets up:** Understanding of the specific technology (LLMs) that powers most AI applications you'll use

**Key connection:** LLMs are a specific application of deep learning (covered in ML 101). This page shows how those ML principles create text-generating AI.

---

### 3. The AI Landscape: Choosing Models and Tools

**Read after:** LLMs 101

**What you'll learn:** Which LLMs and AI tools exist, how to choose between them, and what each is best for

**Sets up:** Practical knowledge of available options before learning to use them

**Key connection:** Now that you know WHAT LLMs are, this shows you WHICH ones to use and when. You'll learn about GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, and when to choose each.

---

## 🛠️ Application Layer: Using AI Effectively

### 4. Context Engineering vs. Prompt Engineering

**Read after:** The AI Landscape

**What you'll learn:** How to get better results from AI by crafting effective prompts and providing the right context

**Sets up:** Basic skills everyone needs to use AI effectively

**Key connection:** You know which models exist - now learn the fundamental techniques for using them well. This is your baseline skillset.

---

### 5. Customizing AI: Fine-Tuning vs. RAG vs. Prompt Engineering

**Read after:** Context Engineering vs. Prompt Engineering

**What you'll learn:** Advanced techniques for making AI work with your specific data and use cases

**Sets up:** Understanding of when to use different customization approaches

**Key connection:** Basic prompting (page 4) handles 60% of needs. This page shows you the advanced techniques for the other 40% - adding your company knowledge, changing AI behavior, and scaling solutions.

---

### 6. CLI Agents vs. Chat-Based AI Performance

**Read after:** Customizing AI

**What you'll learn:** Why command-line AI agents are dramatically more efficient than chat-based AI for complex work

**Sets up:** Understanding of different AI interfaces and their performance characteristics

**Key connection:** After learning to customize AI (page 5), this shows you the most efficient way to actually work with it. You'll understand why architecture matters as much as the AI itself - CLI agents deliver 5-10x speedups not through better models, but through better implementation.

---

### 7. Automation, AI Workflows, and AI Agents

**Read after:** CLI Agents vs. Chat-Based AI Performance

**What you'll learn:** Different architectural patterns for AI applications - from simple automation to autonomous agents

**Sets up:** Strategic framework for choosing how to implement AI in your work

**Key connection:** You know how to use AI efficiently (page 6) - now learn what to build. Should you create simple automation, an AI workflow with human checkpoints, or a fully autonomous agent? This page provides the decision framework for architecting AI solutions.

---

### 8. Multimodal AI: Beyond Text

**Read after:** Automation, AI Workflows, and AI Agents

**What you'll learn:** AI that works with images, audio, video, and combinations - expanding beyond text-only models

**Sets up:** Understanding the full breadth of AI capabilities across all content types

**Key connection:** After mastering text-based AI from theory to implementation (pages 1-7), this expands your understanding to all modalities. You'll see how the same ML principles power image generation, speech recognition, and video analysis - completing your view of what AI can do.

## 📍 Quick Start Paths

### Path 1: "I'm completely new to AI"

➡️ Read in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8

**Why:** Each page builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding from first principles.

---

### Path 2: "I've used ChatGPT, want to get better at AI"

➡️ Start with: 4 (Context/Prompt Engineering) → 5 (Customizing AI) → 3 (AI Landscape)

**Then:** Go back to 1-2 for deeper understanding, or forward to 6-8 for broader applications

**Why:** Jump straight to practical skills, then fill in theory and expand to advanced topics.

---

### Path 3: "I need to choose AI tools for my company"

➡️ Start with: 3 (AI Landscape) → 5 (Customizing AI) → 6 (CLI Agents) → 7 (Automation/Workflows/Agents)

**Then:** Read 1-2 for foundational understanding

**Why:** Focus on decision-making, performance, and architecture first, then deepen technical understanding.

---

### Path 4: "I want to build AI applications"

➡️ Read: 1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7

**Optional:** 8 if working with images/audio/video

**Why:** Foundation → Core technology → Usage techniques → Customization → Architecture → Implementation
